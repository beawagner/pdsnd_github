### Description
Let's explore some US bikeshare data!

The project was created to showcase some exciting statistics about three different cities from the USA, _Chicago_, _New York_ or _Washington_.

The User can choose to see more about one of _these_ cities. They can **further** filter the data by _month_ and/or _day_. After the filtering the they can see the **statistics** for the chosen city: 

    1. popular travel time
        - the most common month
        - the most common day
        - the most common start hour

    2. most popular station and trip
        - the most common start station
        - the most common end station
        - the most common trip (start station - end station combination)

    3. total and average trip duration
        - total travel time
        - average travel time

    4.  on the bikeshare users
        - counts of different user types
        - counts of gender
        - earliest, most recent, most common year of birth

After all the statistics the user has the opportunity to see the **raw data** if they _would like to_. If the answer is _No_, then they can whether restart or quit the program.
